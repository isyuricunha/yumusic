**YuMusic** is an open-source and lightweight music client for Subsonic, designed and built natively for Android. It provides a seamless and intuitive music streaming experience, allowing you to access and play your Subsonic music library directly from your Android device. 

YuMusic does not rely on magic algorithms to decide what you should listen to. Instead, the interface is built around your listening history, randomness, and optionally integrates with services like Last.fm to personalize your music experience.

**If you find YuMusic useful, please consider starring the project on GitHub. It would mean a lot to me and help promote the app to a wider audience.**

**Use the Github version of the app for full Android Auto and Chromecast support.**

## About YuMusic

**YuMusic** is an independent Subsonic music client project, inspired by and based on the excellent work done in the **Tempo** project. This is a completely separate and unaffiliated project that builds upon the foundation established by the original creators.

### Project History & Credits

**Tempo** was originally created by [CappielloAntonio](https://github.com/CappielloAntonio/tempo) who built an amazing Subsonic client from the ground up. When the original repository became inactive, [eddyizm](https://github.com/eddyizm/tempo) created and maintained an active fork, keeping development moving forward with many important improvements.

**YuMusic** is now developed and maintained by **Yuri** ([isyuricunha](https://github.com/isyuricunha)) as an independent project. While inspired by Tempo's excellent foundation, YuMusic is a separate project with its own vision for modern music streaming experience.

**Credits & Acknowledgments:**
- **[CappielloAntonio](https://github.com/CappielloAntonio/tempo)** - Original Tempo creator and developer
- **[eddyizm](https://github.com/eddyizm/tempo)** - Tempo fork maintainer who kept the project thriving
- All contributors who helped improve the Tempo project over time

*YuMusic is released under the same GPL v3.0 license in respect to the original work and community.*

For detailed changes and updates, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
